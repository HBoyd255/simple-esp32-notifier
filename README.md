# Simple ESP32 Notifier

This is just a simple board to hold a
[Heltec WiFi Kit 32 (V3)](https://heltec.org/project/wifi-kit32-v3/) ESP32 dev
kit.

This Heltec board comes with a built in 0.96 OLED screen that is used for
showing notifications, and the board adds 3 LEDs and 3 Buttons.

As this board is designed to be simple it just uses through hole components and
uses one GPIO pin per LED and one per button.
